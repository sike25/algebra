**Injectivity and Identity**

Let S be a non-empty group. 
$$f:S \to T$$ is injective if and only if there exists $$g:T \to S$$ such that $$g \cdot f: S \to T \to S$$ = $$ID_s$$.

**Subsets And Functions**

Let $$f:S \to T$$. For a subset $$A \subset S$$, $$f(A) = {f(s) | s \in S }$$ is a subgroup of T.
If A and B are subgroups of S, 

1. $$f(A \cup B) = f(A) \cup f(B)$$
2. $$f(A \cap B) \subset f(A) \cap f(B)$$
