**Normal Subgroups**

**Normal Subgroups And The Three Pronged Theorem**

**Normalcy of Trivial Subgroups**

**K Normal To G, H Subgroup to G**

**NH**

Let N be a normal subgroup in G and H be any subgroup of G. 
NH = { nh | $$n \in N, h \in H$$ } is a subgroup of G.

**Normalizer**

H is a subgroup of G. N(H) = { $$g \in G | gHg^{-1} = H$$ } is the normalizer of H is G.

1. N(H) is a subgroup of G
2. H $$\Delta$$ N(H)
3. Let $$K \subset G$$ be a subgroup such that $$H \Delta K$$. Prove that $$K \subset N(H)$$.

**Subgroup To Abelian Group**

**Index of H in G is 2**

**gHg-1**

**Quotient Group**

**Order of Normal Coset**

Let G be a group and g $$\in$$ G. Let the order of g be finite and be m.        
Let H $$\Delta$$ G. Then the order of Hg $$\in$$ G/H is finite and divides m.

**Cyclic Quotient Group**

If G is a cyclic group and H is a subgroup of G. Then G/H is cyclic
